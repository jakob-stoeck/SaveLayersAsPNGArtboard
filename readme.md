# About

This is a script which can be used with Adobe Illustrator (I tested only CS4 but others should work).

## Installation

Put it in: /Applications/Adobe Illustrator CS4/Presets/en_US/Scripts and restart Adobe Illustrator. (That's a path for Mac OS, yours may vary)

## Usage

Open the file you want to save and choose from the menu: File > Scripts > SaveLayersAsPngArtboard. A dialog box will open, asking you where to save the resulting files.
